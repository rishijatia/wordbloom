# Challenge Dashboard Feature Implementation

This document tracks the implementation of the WordBloom Challenge Dashboard feature, organized by implementation phases.

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Error Fixes
After initial implementation, we encountered and fixed several Firebase-related errors:

1. **Missing Permissions Error**:
   - Added `device_challenges` collection to the Firestore security rules
   - Created Firebase deployment instructions document to guide setup

2. **Challenge ID Error**:
   - Modified `submitChallengeScore` to return an error object instead of throwing when ID is missing
   - Updated `createChallenge` function in GameContext to handle error cases better
   - Added type checking to ensure challenges have valid IDs before submitting scores

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Challenge Model
- Added `expiresAt` field to store challenge expiration timestamp (24 hours after creation)
- Added `expired` as a new status type
- Added `totalWordsFound` field for storing aggregated word count

#### 2. Created Game Configuration File
- Created `/src/config/gameConfig.json` with constants for:
  - `challengeDurationMs`: 86400000 (24 hours in milliseconds)
  - `gameTimeSeconds`: 120
  - `maxPlayers`: 10
  - `maxChallengesPerDevice`: 50

#### 3. Updated Challenge Creation to Include Expiration
- Modified `createChallenge` function to:
  - Check for device challenge limit
  - Set expiration timestamp using config value
  - Initialize `totalWordsFound` to 0

#### 4. Added Challenge Expiration Utility Function
- Created `isChallengeExpired` helper function for client-side expiration check

#### 5. Added Device Challenge Tracking System
- Created new `deviceChallengeService.ts` for tracking:
  - Challenge creation count per device (with 50 challenge limit)
  - Challenge participation history

#### 6. Added Challenge Dashboard Data Retrieval Functions
- Added `getActiveChallenges`: Fetches active challenges
- Added `getCreatedChallenges`: Fetches challenges created by current device
- Added `getParticipatedChallengeDetails`: Fetches challenges the device has participated in

#### 7. Updated Firebase Indexes
- Added compound indexes to support queries:
  - Status + expiresAt (for active challenges)
  - createdBy + createdAt (for created challenges)

#### 8. Added Scheduled Functions Placeholder
- Created `functions/README.md` with planned scheduled function to handle expired challenges

#### 9. Updated Project README
- Added Challenge Dashboard feature section to project documentation

### Required Firestore Indexes

For this implementation to work correctly, ensure the following Firebase indexes are created in the Firebase Console:

1. Navigate to Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Indexes tab
2. Add the following composite indexes:

| Collection ID | Fields indexed | Query scope | Index type |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|------------|
| challenges    | status (Asc), expiresAt (Asc) | Collection | Composite |
| challenges    | createdBy (Asc), createdAt (Desc) | Collection | Composite |
| challenge_scores | challengeId (Asc), score (Desc) | Collection | Composite |

### Verification Steps

To verify the changes:

1. **Check Challenge Creation**
   - Create a new challenge
   - Verify in Firestore that it includes the `expiresAt` field set to 24 hours after creation
   - Verify the challenge status is set to "active"

2. **Check Device Challenge Limit**
   - Manually add 50 challenges with your device ID in Firestore
   - Try to create a new challenge and verify it returns the limit error

3. **Check Challenges Data Retrieval**
   - Run the `getActiveChallenges()` function and verify it returns only unexpired challenges
   - Run the `getCreatedChallenges()` function and verify it returns challenges you've created
   - Run the `getParticipatedChallengeDetails()` function after playing a challenge to verify it returns participated challenges

4. **Check Expiration Logic**
   - Manually set a challenge's `expiresAt` to a past timestamp
   - Verify the `isChallengeExpired()` function correctly identifies it as expired

## Legacy Data Migration

### Challenge

During implementation, we discovered legacy challenges in the database that were created before the Challenge Dashboard feature and don't have the new required fields:
- Missing `expiresAt` timestamp
- Missing `status` field
- Missing `totalWordsFound` field

### Solution

Created a migration script (`scripts/migrate-legacy-challenges.js`) that:
1. Finds all challenges without the required fields
2. Sets `expiresAt` to 24 hours from now
3. Sets `status` to 'active'
4. Sets `totalWordsFound` to 0 if missing

This approach ensures all challenges will appear correctly in the dashboard and be properly categorized.

### Migration Process
1. Get Firebase Admin SDK credentials from Firebase Console (Service Accounts)
2. Run the migration script with the path to your credentials:
   ```bash
   # Using default path (service-account-key.json in project root)
   node scripts/migrate-legacy-challenges.js
   
   # Or specify a custom path to the service account key
   node scripts/migrate-legacy-challenges.js /path/to/your-service-account-key.json
   ```
3. The script detects and updates all legacy challenges with missing fields
4. Uses batch operations for efficiency and provides detailed logs throughout
