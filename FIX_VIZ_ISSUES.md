# Analysis and Solution Plan

After examining the codebase, I've identified the three issues and prepared a plan to fix them.

## Issue 1: Letter Usage Heatmap - Missing Outer Ring
The heatmap only displays the center letter and inner ring (7 letters total), but doesn't render the outer ring (12 additional letters) that exists in the game screen.

## Issue 2: Leaderboard Rendering Issues
The leaderboard is getting cut off in the web view due to width constraints and improper overflow handling.

## Issue 3: "You haven't played" Message Showing Incorrectly
You're seeing the "You haven't played this challenge" message in the Word Analysis tab even though you have played the challenge.

# Fix Plan

## 1. Protect Letter Grid And Show Complete Grid

### Step 1: Update LetterUsageHeatmap.tsx
- Add a check at the beginning of the component to verify if the user has played:
```
const hasPlayed = scores.some(score => score.deviceId === deviceId);
```

- Create a protected view that only renders if the user has played:
```
if (!hasPlayed) {
  return <NotPlayedMessage>
    You need to play this challenge to see the letter usage heatmap.
  </NotPlayedMessage>;
}
```

### Step 2: Complete the heatmap implementation
- Add code to process outer ring letters in `letterUsageData` calculation:
```
// Add outer ring letters
letterArrangement.outerRing.forEach(letter => {
  result.push({
    letter,
    count: letterCounts.get(letter) || 0,
    totalWords: wordsToAnalyze.length,
    heatLevel: calculateHeatLevel(letterCounts.get(letter) || 0, maxCount)
  });
});
```

### Step 3: Add outer ring rendering
- Create an `OuterRing` styled component
- Add the outer ring rendering code after the inner ring
- Position the outer hexes correctly using CSS similar to the inner ring

## 2. Fix Leaderboard Display

### Step 1: Update Container styling
- Fix Container width constraints:
```
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  flex: 1;
  min-width: 500px;
  max-width: none;
  padding-right: 24px;
  border-right: 1px solid #eee;
}
```

### Step 2: Improve table container
- Add proper overflow handling:
```
const TableContainer = styled.div`
  overflow-x: auto;
  overflow-y: auto;
  max-height: 60vh;
  margin-bottom: 24px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  border-radius: 8px;
`;
```

### Step 3: Update ContentArea in ChallengeDetailScreen
- Make it handle overflow properly:
```
@media (min-width: 1024px) {
  display: flex;
  overflow: visible;
}
```

## 3. Fix "You haven't played" Message

### Step 1: Investigate device ID consistency
- Log and verify the device ID is consistent between plays and viewing:
```
console.log("Current device ID:", getDeviceId());
```

### Step 2: Fix the "hasPlayed" check in WordUniquenessAnalysis
- Ensure WordUniquenessAnalysis is using the correct method to determine if a user has played:
```
// Verify scores are being fetched properly
console.log("Fetched scores:", scores);

// Check if user is in the scores array
const hasPlayed = scores.some(score => score.deviceId === deviceId);
console.log("Has played?", hasPlayed, "Device ID:", deviceId);
```

### Step 3: Implement user score caching
- If scores aren't being fetched or persisted correctly, implement a local session storage fallback:
```
// After successful play, store a flag
sessionStorage.setItem(`played_challenge_${challengeId}`, 'true');

// Check both the scores and the session storage
const hasPlayed = scores.some(score => score.deviceId === deviceId) || 
  sessionStorage.getItem(`played_challenge_${challengeId}`) === 'true';
```

### Step 4: Add refresh capabilities
- Add a refresh button on the Word Analysis screen that users can click if their data isn't showing up:
```
<RefreshButton onClick={fetchData}>
  Refresh Data
</RefreshButton>
```

By implementing these changes, users will only see the letter grid after playing, the grid will show all three tiers of letters, the leaderboard will display properly without being cut off, and the "You haven't played" message will only appear when actually appropriate.
